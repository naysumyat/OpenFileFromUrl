OpenFileFromUrl
===============

Brackets extension that opens href and rel URLs to files.


To install, place the ```OpenFileFromUrl``` folder inside the ```brackets/src/extensions/user``` folder.

**Compatible with Brackets Sprint13**

Press ```ALT+O``` on any ```href``` or ```rel``` atribute and it will open it in editor.

Becoause of current File API limmitations could not integrate creating of the file if not exist. Will be there when brackets implements File API.
